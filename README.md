# Portfolio-trials
This is a personal repo for my tech portfolio website files and coding exercises/challenges I do in my free time.

### Bulma
I made my website using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), a light-weight and mobile-first framework. I worked with Bootstrap at The Tech Academy, and I wanted to challegen myself to pick up a new framework from scratch and see how much I could do. It was pretty easy to use, and I enjoyed the challenge. I'm still working on it!
